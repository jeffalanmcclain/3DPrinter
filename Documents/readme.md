# Debug Stuff

- To check for errors on canbus (non-invasive)

```
candump can0,0~0,#FFFFFFFF
```

- To generate canbus loading (kills klipper, if it is running)

```
cangen -e -g 0.12 can0
```

- To watch for traffic on the canbus

```
watch -n 1 -d "ip -details -statistics link show can0"
watch -n 1 "tc -s qdisc show dev can0"
```

- To watch load on the canbus (as percentage %)

```
canbusload can0@1000000 -b -c
```
