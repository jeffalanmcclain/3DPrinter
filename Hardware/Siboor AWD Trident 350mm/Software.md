| Orca Slicer Custom Bedmap | Created a custom bedmap for the XOL front AWD keep out area.  I have the [custom STL](../../Config/Siboor%20AWD%20Trident%20350mm/ORCA/Custom%20Siboor%20350%20XOL%20umbilical.stl) for the bed in the config/Orca section. | <img alt="Gantry" width=320 src="assets/orca_bedmap.png"> |
| [SAMBA setup Guide](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-samba/) | Adding a SAMBA share to your CB2/CM4/RPi4 main processor makes it easy to share with windows file mounts.  I'm using this to allow me to directly edit/push/sync to GIT. | |
