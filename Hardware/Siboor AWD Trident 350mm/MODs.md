| [CM4 4GB/32GB](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Raspberry-Pi-Compute-Module-CM4104032-p-4722.html) | Got this to try to avoid all the Timer Too Close MCU fails and have enough resources to manage two webcams and have more onboard storage than the CB2 offering. So far, once I eliminated the [LED Effects](https://github.com/julianschill/klipper-led_effect) plug-in module, which was causing massive TTC failures on both the Manta MCU and EBB36 MCU, it has handled everything like a champ. | :star::star::star::star: |  <img alt="CM4 4GB/32GB" width=320 src="assets/CM4_4GB_32GB.jpg"> |
| [TMC5160T Pro drivers](https://www.amazon.com/BIGTREETECH-TMC5160T-High-Speed-Printing-Heatsink/dp/B09JS5YDQN/ref=sr_1_2) | Really good higher power drivers to support 48v | :star::star::star::star: |  <img alt="TMC5160Pro drivers" width=320 src="assets/TMC5160TPro.jpg"> |
| [48v 200W PSU](https://west3d.com/products/mean-well-uhp-200-48-200w-48v-4-2a-power-supply-psu-1?_pos=1&_sid=3af408982&_ss=r) | HV supply for X/Y motors to run at 48v | :star::star::star::star: | <img alt="Meanwell 200W 48V PSU" width=320 src="assets/Meanwell_48v_200W.jpg"> |
| [5v 15W PSU](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005T6UJBU/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) | Simple PSU for dedicated supply to chamber LEDs and a powered USB hub. Probably needed a little more than just 15W out of this to get better rating. | :star::star::star: | <img alt="Meanwell 15W 5V PSU" width=320 src="assets/Meanwell_5v_15W.jpg"> |
| [USB hub](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CWNPTH8F?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) | Simple and small hub expansion. Wish it was powered (may hack it to add in 5V supply) | :star::star::star: | <img alt="USB hub" width=320 src="assets/USB_Hub.jpg"> |
| [Logitech C920](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085TFF7M1?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1) (x2) | Specs: 1080p/30fps and 78' FoV.  This really needs more like 100' FoV and fixed focus and it would be better, but color and low light works well. | :star::star: | <img alt="Logitech C920" width=320 src="assets/Logitech_C920.jpg"> <img alt="Twin Cam View" width=320 src="assets/twin_cam_view.jpg"> |
| [Printables Corner Mount STL](https://www.printables.com/model/1101887-logitech-c920-2020-corner-mount) | 2020 Extrusion corner mount for Logitech C920 | :star::star::star: | <img alt="USB Cam Corner mount" width=320 src="assets/corner_cam_mount.jpg"> <img alt="USB Cam Corner mount" width=320 src="assets/IMG_0622.JPG"> |
| [BTT K-Touch wireless screen](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D4YTSLDZ?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) | Wireless battery powered display works, but needs better firmware support to add more features more like KlipperScreen. I got it on black Friday sale, and it "works" but just waiting for them to maybe improve the firmware. | :star::star: | <img alt="BTT K-Touch wireless screen" width=320 src="assets/BTT_KTouch.jpg"> |
| [Annex-Eng panel clips](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Annex-Engineering_User_Mods/tree/main/Printers/All_Printers/annex_dev-Panel_2020_Clips_and_Hinges) | **Top & Back** panel using 5.0mm with 3mm foam tape (use 3.5mm clips for back if using stock 1mm foam).  **Side** panels using 5.5mm clips with 3mm foam | :star::star::star::star::star: |  <img alt="Annex-Eng panel clips" width=320 src="assets/IMG_0588.JPG">  <img alt="Annex-Eng panel clips" width=320 src="assets/IMG_0591.JPG"> |
| [Network keystone](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0116T7XMQ?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1) | Doesn't fit in printed square slot great, but I think that is a problem with skirt model | :star::star::star::star: | <img alt="Network keystone" width=320 src="assets/network_keystone.jpg"> |
| [USB keystones](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078935SFG?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1) | Doesn't fit in printed square slot great, but I think that is a problem with skirt model | :star::star::star::star: | <img alt="USB keystones" width=320 src="assets/usb_keystone.jpg"> |
| [270mm Disco LED sticks](https://www.siboor.com/product/voron-2-4-v2-4-3d-printer-daylight-disco-on-a-stick-pcb-kits-5v-lamp-bar-270-158mm-for-voron-0-1-0-2-2-4-trident-350-300-250mm/) (x4) | 270mm WS2812B 5v 18-LED light bar. Needs VCC/GND solder pads at other end too | :star::star::star: | <img alt="Disco LEDs" width=320 src="assets/IMG_0592.JPG"> <img alt="Disco LEDs" width=320 src="assets/IMG_0598.JPG"> |
| [LED Bar Clip Misumi v2](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/blob/main/printer_mods/eddie/LED_Bar_Clip/LED_Bar_Clip_Misumi_version2.stl) | Need to size up 10% to fit the Disco LEDs I got and to fit snug in 2020 extrusion. Also, slot makes it difficult to fit pass on wiring through. | :star::star::star: | <img alt="Disco LEDs" width=320 src="assets/led_bar_clip_misumi.jpg"> |
| Rear motor flip | Easy to do, and required for XOL toolhead clearance | :star::star::star: | <img alt="Rear Motor flip" width=320 src="assets/IMG_0534.JPG"> |
| Additional Temp sensors | One at **TOP** of chamber and one at **Bottom** plus x1 in electronics bay near drivers. | :star::star::star::star: | <img alt="Temp Sensor" width=320 src="assets/IMG_0597z.jpg"> <img alt="Temp Sensor" width=320 src="assets/IMG_0577.JPG"> <img alt="Temp Sensor" width=320 src="assets/IMG_0679.JPG"> |
| [Thermistor 2020 mount](https://mods.vorondesign.com/details/dfRX88k7wwS6tpYlvyCEw) | great 3mm t-nut mount for thermistor.  Might be a little bulkier than necessary. | :star::star::star::star: | <img alt="2020 Temp Sensor mount" width=320 src="assets/extrusion_thermistor_holder.png"> |
| [XOL toolhead](https://github.com/Armchair-Heavy-Industries/Xol-Toolhead) | Ugly, but light and very functional print head with lots of extruder/hotend support. I would like a little more powerful fans (may need to look into higher RPM Delta fans) | :star::star::star::star: | <img alt="XOL + EBB36 + G2SA" width=320 src="assets/IMG_0645.JPG"> |
| [Rapido2 UHF PT1000](https://www.phaetus.com/products/rapido2?variant=45177211060501) Hotend | Great Ultra High Flow with 0.4mm and 0.6mm Hardened nozzles | :star::star::star::star: | <img alt="Rapido2 UHF PT1000" width=320 src="assets/rapido2HF.png"> |
| [EBB36 Toolhead Board](https://github.com/bigtreetech/EBB) | Pretty typical board for this toolhead. Documentation could have been more clear and better, especially for PT1000 sensor pins. I **also** am frustrated that the included PT1000 secondary sensor doesn't work if using the main one. | :star::star::star::star: | <img alt="EBB36 Wiring" width=320 src="assets/EBB36_wiring.jpg"> |
| [Galileo 2 Stand Alone](https://github.com/JaredC01/Galileo2/tree/main/galileo2_standalone) Extruder | Really happy with this large extruder. Pulls hard and single gear with idler design, so should avoid some of the binding extrusion artifacts | :star::star::star::star: | <img alt="G2SA" width=320 src="assets/IMG_0179.JPG"> |    
| [XOL EBB36 + G2SA drag chain mount](https://www.printables.com/model/794851-xol-horizontal-drag-chain-ebb36-for-g2sa) | Needed some modification to fit my chain plus, it needed to sit higher on the toolhead. | :star::star::star: | <img alt="Drag chain mount to EBB36" width=320 src="assets/IMG_0772.JPG"> |
| Cartographer mounts | Printed 4.5mm spacers for the bottom to setup the cartographer with proper 2.5mm-3.0mm spacing up from nozzle. | :star::star::star: | <img alt="Cartographer mount spacers" width=320 src="assets/IMG_0827.JPG"> |
| **Horizontal drag chain elim and move to umbilical** [PG7 2020 mount](https://www.printables.com/model/1099507-voron-trident-pg7-mount-bracket) | Good mount for the PG7 cable in the 2020 corner | :star::star::star::star: | <img alt="2020 PG7 mount" width=320 src="assets/IMG_0902.JPG"> |
| **Horizontal drag chain elim and move to umbilical** [EBB36 PG7 mount](https://www.printables.com/make/2268162) | Good mount for the XOL toolhead on G2SA + EBB36 board for PG7 | :star::star::star::star: | <img alt="Cartographer mount spacers" width=320 src="assets/IMG_0873.JPG"> |
| [PTFE bend support](https://www.printables.com/make/2268145) | Keeps PTFE tube from bending/collapsing | :star::star::star: | <img alt="PTFE tube support" width=320 src="assets/IMG_0895.JPG"> <img alt="CPTFE tube support" width=320 src="assets/IMG_0901.JPG"> |
| [Internal Spool Holder](https://www.printables.com/model/1105610-spring-loaded-internal-spool-holder) | Spring tensioned Internal 1Kg spool holder with rollers. I need to redesign it a touch to allow spring mount bolts to be recessed because it interferes with electronics bay panel removal as it is. | :star::star::star::star:| <img alt="Internal Spool Holder" width=320 src="assets/IMG_0761.png"> <img alt="Internal Spool Holder" width=320 src="assets/IMG_0767.JPG"> |
| [Armored Turtle 4-to-1 Filament Hub](https://github.com/ArmoredTurtle/BoxTurtle/blob/main/STLs/Legacy/%5Ba%5D_hub_D2F.stl) | Works to combine up to 4 sources, but wish it had a standard Voron micro-switch for run-out sensor | :star::star::star: | <img alt="Armored Turtle 4-to-1 Filament Hub" width=320 src="assets/IMG_0776.png"> <img alt="Filament Hub" width=320 src="assets/IMG_0904a.jpg"> |
| [Voron Strengthened X Handles](https://www.printables.com/model/1053718-strengthened-voron-x-handles) | If you want/need handles on the top to lift | :star::star::star::star: | <img alt="Voron Strengthened X Handles" width=320 src="assets/x-handles.png"> |
