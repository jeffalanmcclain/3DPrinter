# The Build

| [Manta M8p v2](https://github.com/bigtreetech/Manta-M8P) and CM4 prep | I went ahead and flashed new OS image for the CM4 and got all the Klipper, Fluidd, Mainsail, Moonraker, Crowsnest, Spoolman stuff setup with [kiauh](https://github.com/dw-0/kiauh) script | <img alt="Manta M8P Pin out" width=320 src="assets/manta_pinout.png"> <img alt="TMC5160Pro drivers" width=320 src="assets/IMG_0334.JPG"> |
| 2020 Frame | Built the frame on a nice, flat granite counter-top and used blue loc-tite on all the extrusion screws.  Careful to measure diagonals and keep square and measure gantry and ensure parallel to bottom. | <img alt="350mm Frame" width=320 src="assets/IMG_0342.JPG"> |
| Gantry | Construction of the CNC Aluminum mounts and rails as well as the AWD motor system | <img alt="Gantry" width=320 src="assets/IMG_0455.JPG"> <img alt="X-axis Shaper" width=320 src="assets/shaper_calibrate_x.png"> <img alt="Y-axis Shaper" width=320 src="assets/shaper_calibrate_y.png"> |
| Bed | 1000W bed heater and magnetic pad on the 350mm Aluminum block | <img alt="Bed" width=320 src="assets/IMG_0527.JPG"> <img alt="Bed" width=320 src="assets/IMG_0534.JPG"> <img alt="90C Bedmesh" width=320 src="assets/90C_Bedmesh.jpg"> |
| Electronics | Lots of stuff in here.  Started with HV/AC routing, and I wish I could have kept the HV lines in separate channel from LV wiring. Had to redrill/tap most of the holes in the bottom panel to allow the 48v/5v PSUs in addition to the stock 24v PSU | <img alt="Electronics" width=320 src="assets/IMG_0519.JPG"> <img alt="Electronics" width=320 src="assets/IMG_0556.JPG"> <img alt="Electronics" width=320 src="assets/IMG_0581.JPG"> |
| Panels | Door panel construction was very confusing on the orientation for the right fit with the seals, but got it. [Annex-Eng Panel clips](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Annex-Engineering_User_Mods/tree/main/Printers/All_Printers/annex_dev-Panel_2020_Clips_and_Hinges) MOD was money and I LOVE the [Clicky-Clacky Fridge door](https://github.com/tanaes/whopping_Voron_mods/tree/main/clickyclacky_door) MOD included in this kit | <img alt="Panels" width=320 src="assets/IMG_0781.JPG"> <img alt="Panels" width=320 src="assets/IMG_0810.JPG"> |
| Misc | Firmware installation of canbus was VERY painful, but mostly because the Manta guide didn't really address it.  [Esoterical Canbus Guide](https://canbus.esoterical.online/) was a HUGE help here. | <img alt="Can0 bus error" width=320 src="assets/mcu_can0_error.jpg"> <img alt="UUID dump" width=320 src="assets/UUID_dump.jpg"> |
